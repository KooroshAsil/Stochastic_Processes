## Stochastic Process Simulations

This repository contains Python scripts to simulate and visualize various stochastic processes. It serves as a practical resource for understanding the behavior of these probabilistic models.

### Processes Included

- **Markov Chains**: Discrete-time stochastic processes that satisfy the Markov property.
- **Brownian Motion**: Continuous-time stochastic processes used to model random movements.
- **Poisson Processes**: Stochastic processes used for modeling the occurrences of events at random points in time.

### Overview

Each script is designed to:

1. Simulate the respective stochastic process.
2. Visualize the simulated paths, often with options for both static and animated plots.
3. Provide statistical insights into the generated data.
